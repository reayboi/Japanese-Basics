<h1>Let's start learning the ひらがな! (Hi-ra-ga-na)</h1>
<p>Argueably the best way to learn the <b>ひらがな</b> is through the memorization of this table.</p><hr/>

<div id="plain hiragana">
	<p><b>あいうえお<br>かきくけこ<br>さしすせそ<br>たちつてと<br>なにぬねの<br>はひふへほ<br>まみむめも<br>らりるれろ<br>やゆよ<br>わを<br>ん</b></p>
</div>

<p><i>Don't panic yet</i>! Although these <b>46</b> characters may seem overwhelming now; once you start practising, it'll become a blast.<br>You might be thinking "how am I supposed to learn the <b>ひらがな</b> if I can't say them!?". The <u>Romanji</u> makes our lives easier providing English translations of Japanese words.<br><b>For example:</b><br>あ = a<br>Below I will show you the translations for each of the characters...</p>

<div id="hiragana translation">
	<p>あ = a, い = i, う = u, え = e, お = o <br>か = ka, き = ki, く = ku, け = ke, こ = ko <br>さ = sa, し = shi, す = su, せ = se, そ = so <br>た = ta, ち = chi, つ = tsu, て = te, と = to <br>な = na, に = ni, ぬ = nu, ね = ne, の = no <br>は = ha, ひ = hi, ふ = fu, へ = he, ほ = ho <br>ま = ma, み = mi, む = mu, め = me, も = mo <br>ら = ra, り = ri, る = ru, れ = re, ろ = ro <br>や = ya, ゆ = yu, よ = yo <br>わ = wa, を = wo <br> ん = n </p>
</div>
	
<p>The best methods of learning the <b>ひらがな</b> would be writing them out like a <b>million times</b> (for me this took around one-->three days). Trust me when I say it works.<br> Before you start doodling these characters, you must be informed about <u><a href="stroke order.html">stroke order</a></u> and it's vital importance in writing something legible.<br>By the end of the week you will be pro! But the fun ends there; as I regret to inform you about the existence of Diacritics and Digraphs</p>

<hr/>

<div id="hiragana diacritics">
	<h3>Diacritics</h3>
	<p><b>What are the Diacritics?</b><br>Diacritics are constanants that don't have their own unique <b>ひらがな</b> characters. Instead they share the same characters as some other <b>ひらがな</b>.<br>Below are the all of the Diacritics you need to know.</p>
</div>

<div id="hiragana diacritics">
	<p><b>がぎぐげご<br>ざじずぜぞ<br>だぢづでど<br>ばびぶべぼ<br>ぱぴぷぺぽ</b></p>
</div>

<p>As you can see there aren't many of them and they're <b>SUPER</b> easy to differentiate between their originals due to the double line at the top right corner of the character(s).<br>I'll provide translations of the Diacritics as I have done with their original <b>ひらがな</b> characters.</p>

<div id="hiragana diacritic translations">
	<p>が = ga, ぎ = gi, ぐ = gu, げ = ge, ご = go <br>ざ = za, じ = ji, ず = zu, ぜ = ze, ぞ = zo <br>だ = da, ぢ = ji, づ = zu, で = de, ど = do <br>ば = ba, び = bi, ぶ = bu, べ = be, ぼ = bo <br>ぱ = pa, ぴ = pi, ぷ = pu, ぺ = pe, ぽ = po</p>
</div>

<p><u><b>NB</b></u>: Notice the similiarity between <b>じ</b> and <b>ぢ</b> (both make the 'ji' sound) and also <b>ず</b> and <b>づ</b> (both make the 'zu' sound) - Try not to mix them up.</p>

<hr/>

<div id="Digraphs">

<h3>Digraphs</h3>
<p><b>What are they anyway?</b><br>Digraphs are an unfortuante addition to the Japanese language, but they must be learnt. When you place two <b>ひらがな</b> characters together they can form a new sound.<br>The Digraphs affect these characters: き, し, ち, に, ひ, み, り.</p>

<div id="hiragana digraphs plain">
    <p><b>きゃ, しゃ, ちゃ, にゃ, ひゃ, みゃ, りゃ<br>きゅ, しゅ, ちゅ, にゅ, ひゅ, みゅ, りゅ<br>きょ, しよ, ちよ, によ, ひよ, みよ, りよ</b></p> 
</div>

<div id="hiragana digraphs translation">
	<p>きゃ = kya, しゃ = sha, ちゃ = cha, にゃ = nya, ひゃ = hya, みゃ = mya, りゃ = rya<br>きゅ = kyu, しゅ = shu, ちゅ = chu, にゅ = nyu, ひゅ = hyu, みゅ = myu, りゅ = ryu<br>きょ = kyo, しよ = sho, ちよ = cho, によ = nyo, ひよ = hyo, みよ = myo, りよ = ryo</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Now that we're done with that let's move on to the remaining <b><a href="katakana.html">カタカナ</a></b> and <a href="kanji.html">漢字</a>.</p>
